# Pub kata - CoffeeScript

This is my worked example from the 27th meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. I've used Node.js and CoffeeScript with the Mocha testing library and the Chai assertion library. Install dependencies with:

    npm install

Now the tests can be run from the command-line with [mocha](http://mochajs.org/):

    npm test
